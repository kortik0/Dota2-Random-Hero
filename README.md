## ‚Ñπ  Overview

I think most players who just started the game, or it‚Äôs been 10 years since the first game, sometimes think *Which hero should I pick in the next game?* I am one of them. Dota is probably a dead game, but sometimes you think to return and try to see what changed in the game, and don't know which hero to pick, this may put you into a 10 minute of torturing to select which texture you would like better. So why you need to torturing yourself? Just use this service!

## üí≠ Feedback and Contributing

This service, like a much more things, cannot be perfect. I play Dota for fun once in a year and can't to monitoring all changes. And no one is a perfect programmer and can't know everything, so if you think that there is some spaghetti code, or you catch a bug, or you may change something or make it better, so please do! I will mention you.
